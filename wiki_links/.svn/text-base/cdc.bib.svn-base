  abstract = {This article shows how finite-state methods can be employed in a new
	and different task: the conflation of personal name variants in standard
	forms. In bibliographic databases and citation index systems, variant
	forms create problems of inaccuracy that affect information retrieval,
	the quality of information from databases, and the citation statistics
	used for the evaluation of scientists' work. A number of approximate
	string matching techniques have been developed to validate variant
	forms, based on similarity and equivalence relations. We classify
	the personal name variants as nonvalid and valid forms. In establishing
	an equivalence relation between valid variants and the standard form
	of its equivalence class, we defend the application of finite-state
	transducers. The process of variant identification requires the elaboration
	of: (a) binary matrices and (b) finite-state graphs. This procedure
	was tested on samples of author names from bibliographic records,
	selected from the Library and Information Science Abstracts and Science
	Citation Index Expanded databases. The evaluation involved calculating
	the measures of precision and recall, based on completeness and accuracy.
	The results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, although
	it should be complemented with methods based on similarity relations
	for the recognition of spelling variants and misspellings.},

	may have multiple names and multiple authors may share the same name.
	Such name ambiguity affects the performance of document retrieval,
	web search, database integration, and may cause improper attribution
	to authors. This paper investigates two supervised learning approaches
	to disambiguate authors in the citations. One approach uses the naive
	Bayes probability model, a generative model; the other uses Support
	Vector Machines(SVMs) [The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory]
	and the vector space representation of citations, a discriminative
	model. Both approaches utilize three types of citation attributes:
	co-author names, the title of the paper, and the title of the journal
	or proceeding. We illustrate these two approaches on two types of
	data, one collected from the web, mainly publication lists from homepages,
	the other collected from the DBLP citation databases.},

  abstract = {It is relatively common for different people or organizations to share
	the same name. Given the increasing amount of information available
	online, this results in the ever growing possibility of finding misleading
	or incorrect information due to confusion caused by an ambiguous
	name. This paper presents an unsupervised approach that resolves
	name ambiguity by clustering the instances of a given name into groups,
	each of which is associated with a distinct underlying entity. The
	features we employ to represent the context of an ambiguous name
	are statistically significant bigrams that occur in the same context
	as the ambiguous name. From these features we create a co–occurrence
	matrix where the rows and columns represent the first and second
	words in bigrams, and the cells contain their log–likelihood scores.
	Then we represent each of the contexts in which an ambiguous name
	appears with a second order context vector. This is created by taking
	the average of the vectors from the co–occurrence matrix associated
	with the words that make up each context. This creates a high dimensional
	ldquoinstance by wordrdquo matrix that is reduced to its most significant
	dimensions by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The different ldquomeaningsrdquo
	of a name are discriminated by clustering these second order context
	vectors with the method of Repeated Bisections. We evaluate this
	approach by conflating pairs of names found in a large corpus of
	text to create ambiguous pseudo-names. We find that our method is
	significantly more accurate than the majority classifier, and that
	the best results are obtained by having a small amount of local context
	to represent the instance, along with a larger amount of context
	for identifying features, or vice versa.},

	It improves on the original approach by: (1) grounding the scoring
	scheme in terms of a model; (2) producing more intuitive recall and
	precision scores; and (3) not requiring explicit computation of the
	transitive closure of coreference. The principal conceptual difference
	is that we have moved from a syntactic scoring model based on following
	coreference links to an approach defined by the model theory of those
	links.},
