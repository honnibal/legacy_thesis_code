 \p I am focussing on a representation problem, rather than the learning problem. But
    do these tasks all fit in one hypothesis space? Will the task be tractable?
 \p It's currently very difficult to deploy a system that makes use of all the NLU modules.
 \p If my approach works, it will produce a very efficient all-singing-all-dancing NLU solution.
 \p The project also raises a lot of questions about our current theories of compositional semantics.
