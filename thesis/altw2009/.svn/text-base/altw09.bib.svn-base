  abstract = {Cross-document coreference occurs when the same person, place, event,
	or concept is discussed in more than one text source. Computer recognition
	of this phenomenon is important because it helps break "the document
	boundary" by allowing a user to examine information about a particular
	entity from multiple text sources at the same time. In this paper
	we describe a cross-document coreference resolution algorithm which
	uses the Vector Space Model to resolve ambiguities between people
	having the same name. In addition, we also describe a scoring algorithm
	for evaluating the cross-document coreference chains produced by
	our system and we compare our algorithm to the scoring algorithm
	used in the MUC-6 (within document) coreference task.},
